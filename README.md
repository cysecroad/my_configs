# Actually Useful Linux Config Files 🚀

¡Hola tech amigos! This repo contains my battle-tested Linux configurations that actually make you more productive (and not just make your terminal look fancy).

## What's Inside

Essential configurations for your daily Linux life:
- `.bashrc` - Making your shell work for you, not against you
